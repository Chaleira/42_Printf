# 42 Printf

Welcome to the 42 Printf project repository! This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and focuses on implementing your own version of the printf function in C.

## Introduction

The 42 Printf project involves implementing a simplified version of the printf function from the C standard library. The printf function is used to format and print output to the standard output stream (stdout) according to a specified format string. Your goal is to create your own implementation of printf, including support for various format specifiers and flags.

## Features

- Implementation of a simplified printf function
- Support for format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%d`, `%x`)
- Handling of format flags and modifiers (e.g., `0`, `-`, `+`, `*`)
- Handling of width and precision specifications
